=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Net::Statsd::Client;
    my $stats = Net::Statsd::Client->new(prefix => "service.frobnitzer.");

    my $timer = $stats->timer("request_duration");
    # ... do something expensive ...
    $timer->finish;

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Net::Statsd::Client::Timer->new(...)

To build a timer object, call L<Net::Statsd::Client>'s C<timer> method,
instead of calling this constructor directly.

A timer has an associated statsd object, metric name, and sample rate, and
begins counting as soon as it's constructed.

=head2 $timer->finish

Stop timing, and send the elapsed time to the server.

=head2 $timer->cancel

Stop timing, but do not send the elapsed time to the server. A timer that
goes out of scope without having C<finish> or C<cancel> called on it will
generate a warning, since this probably points to bugs and lost timing
information.
